#### RESTful API contraints

* Client - Server Architecture (Seperation od Concerns, RESTful API should not care about the UI)
* Stateless - No Client-Context(e.g Sessions) is stored on the server.
* Cacheability - Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
* Layered System - Intermediate server maybe used without the client knowing about it.
* Uniform Interface - Resources are identified in Requests, transferred data is decoupled from db schema.
* Code on Demand (optional) - Executable code could be transferred.
